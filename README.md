# British Airways Internship - Forage Project

Welcome to the Readme file for my internship project with British Airways on the Forage platform. This project involved working on two tasks: Task 1 - Analyzing customer reviews using sentiment analysis, and Task 2 - Creating a classification model to predict customer buying behavior. In this document, I will provide an overview of the project, the tasks performed, and the outcomes achieved.

## Project Overview

During my internship at British Airways, I had the opportunity to work on a project that focused on understanding customer sentiments and predicting their buying behavior. The primary goal was to gain insights from customer reviews and develop models to support data-driven decision-making within the organization.

## Task 1: Analyzing Customer Reviews using Sentiment Analysis

For the first task, I applied web scraping techniques to extract unstructured data from the [Airline Quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways) website. The data consisted of customer reviews related to British Airways. Using sentiment analysis, I analyzed these reviews to classify them as positive or negative based on the sentiment expressed by customers.

The steps performed for Task 1 were as follows:

1. Web Scraping: I used web scraping techniques to gather customer reviews from the specified URL.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data was cleaned and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant information and noise.
3. Sentiment Analysis: I applied natural language processing techniques to determine the sentiment of each review.
4. Classification: Based on the sentiment analysis, the reviews were classified into positive and negative categories.
5. Insights and Analysis: The results were analyzed, and key insights were extracted from the data. These findings were then presented using a PowerPoint presentation.

## Task 2: Creating a Classification Model for Customer Buying Behavior

The second task focused on developing a classification model to predict customer buying behavior. The goal was to create a model that could accurately predict whether a customer would make a purchase based on various features and attributes.

The steps performed for Task 2 were as follows:

1. Data Collection: Relevant data, including customer attributes and purchasing history, was collected and prepared for analysis.
2. Data Preprocessing: The collected data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling.
3. Feature Engineering: I identified and engineered relevant features to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. Model Training: I developed a classification model using suitable machine learning algorithms.
5. Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess its performance.
6. Insights and Analysis: The results and analysis of the model were presented using a PowerPoint presentation, highlighting key insights and recommendations.
